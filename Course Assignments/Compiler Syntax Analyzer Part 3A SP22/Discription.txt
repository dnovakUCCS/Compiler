The sample Syntactic: Syntactic3A-SP22.java Download Syntactic3A-SP22.java   Note that SimpleExpression is dummied in and needs completion! Works with Mini test below as-is.

Below are a minimal sample test input file and its output.  They are provided to help get the initial program set up correctly, and are not to be submitted.

For this assignment, be careful to turn in ALL the following as separate files.  READ CAREFULLY, as substantial points will be deducted for any omissions:

1) Your main program must print as the first line of console output exactly the following:

Your Name, Last 4 of student number, CS4100, SPRING 2022, Compiler IDE used: (NetBeans, Eclipse, etc.

2) Your turn-ins for the 3 runs using the given test files MUST capture the entire compiler output, showing that the program compiled and ran on your machine.  Use the SAVE AS from the console context menu to capture the complete text of the run.  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, it must be exactly what the compiler produced.

3) Be sure to turn in all of the following files submitted to Canvas:

     a. Code for your slightly modified main,java and greatly enhanced syntactic.java files.  The syntactic file will be graded for correctness and clarity in the documentation of the non-terminal functions that were added by the student to complete the assignment. 

    b. Three console output capture files as described, for the runs of the 3 files above.  There will correct output file given for this assignment is for the GOOD file.

A total of FIVE files should be submitted for this assignment.
